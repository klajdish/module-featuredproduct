# FeaturedProduct Module

This Magento 2 module adds a custom featured product block to the homepage, with configurable options for SKU and image placement.

## Features

- **Product SKU Configuration**: Set the featured product SKU directly from the admin panel via the system configuration.
- **Image Placement Option**: Choose where the product image appears on desktop view â€” either on the left or the right of the product details.
- **Responsive Design**: The block is fully responsive, with a two-column layout on desktop and a one-column layout on mobile.
- **No SKU? No Block!**: If no SKU is set in the configuration, the block will not be displayed.
  
## Requirements

- **Magento Version**: Tested on Magento 2.4.6-p3.
- **PHP Version**: Compatible with PHP 8.0+ (tested on PHP 8.1).

## Installation

### Type 1: Zip file

After installation, the module can be configured via the Magento admin panel:

## Notes

- **CSS BEM Methodology**: The LESS styles follow the BEM methodology for better structure and maintainability.
- **PHPCS Standard**: Applied Magento2 PHPCS coding standards.
- **General vs Specific Classes**: I intended to create more general classes, but those are better suited for theme-level scope.
